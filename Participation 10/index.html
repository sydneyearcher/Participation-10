            <h3>My Process in Creating This Font</h3>

            <p>When creating this font I started off with basically nothing. No idea, no reference, just playing around
                with the many controls. It soon started to take shape of what I could only define as a retro font. It
                reminds me of the 50s in a way which was why I chose lime green for the background of this web page-a
                color I think goes hand in hand with the 50s. I also added a little picture to liven the site up which
                further prompted me to do a little remodel. The image reminded me of the Aphex Twin song QKThr, which
                influenced me to change up the lime green background to a more somber color. Hence the charmingly eerie
                website you have before you. </p>
